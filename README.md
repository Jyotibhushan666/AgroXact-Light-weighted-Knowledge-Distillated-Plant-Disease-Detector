**AgroXact: Lightweight and Deployable Plant Disease Detection and Severity Estimation Using Knowledge Distillation with Android App Implementation**

Abstract:
Plant disease detection is critical for sustainable agriculture and food security. However, deploying deep learning models in real-world environments is challenging due to domain shifts between controlled lab conditions and diverse field conditions, as well as the computational burden of large architectures. AgroXact addresses these challenges by providing a lightweight framework that uses knowledge distillation to detect plant leaf diseases and estimate their severity efficiently on mobile devices.

The framework combines the PlantVillage (laboratory) and PlantDoc (field) datasets to capture diverse visual conditions. A high-capacity teacher model (EfficientNet-B4) is trained and its knowledge distilled into a compact student model (EfficientNet-B0), optimized for real-time performance. Using an Attention + Cross-Entropy distillation strategy, the model achieves high accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference latency. Additionally, a confidence-based severity estimation module predicts disease progression without requiring extra labels. To demonstrate practical deployment, the Android Studio app code is also provided, allowing users to perform real-time disease detection and severity estimation directly on smartphones. This makes AgroXact a practical and efficient solution for field applications in agriculture.
