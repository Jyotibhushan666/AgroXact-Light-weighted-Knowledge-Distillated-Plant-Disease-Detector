Plant disease detection is important for sustainable agriculture and food security, but deploying deep learning models in real-world settings is challenging due to field variations and large model sizes. We present AgroXact, a lightweight framework that uses knowledge distillation to detect plant diseases and estimate their severity on mobile devices. We combine PlantVillage (lab) and PlantDoc (field) datasets to handle diverse visual conditions. A high-capacity teacher model (EfficientNet-B4) transfers its knowledge to a compact student model (EfficientNet-B0) optimized for real-time performance. Using an Attention+Cross-Entropy distillation strategy, the model achieves 95.6% accuracy with reduced size and latency. Additionally, we provide the Android Studio app code that implements the model, enabling real-time disease detection and severity estimation on smartphones, making AgroXact practical for field deployment.
